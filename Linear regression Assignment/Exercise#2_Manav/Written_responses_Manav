Comparative Analysis
R-squared Score
For Model 1, the R-squared score reflects how well the three chosen features explain the variance in bike rentals. In
Model 2, which includes windspeed, we expect the R-squared to improve, indicating that this additional feature helps
capture more variability in bike counts. A significant increase in the score would suggest that windspeed is a valuable
predictor.

Coefficient Comparison
Examining the coefficients of both models reveals how each feature affects bike rental counts. In Model 1, the
coefficients for temperature, apparent temperature, and humidity will show their individual contributions. When we look
at Model 2, the coefficient for windspeed will indicate whether it has a positive or negative impact on bike rentals. If
the coefficients for temperature and humidity shift notably in Model 2, this might suggest interactions or
multicollinearity among the features.

Performance Insights
If Model 2 has a significantly higher R-squared score than Model 1, it would support the idea that including windspeed
adds meaningful information for predicting bike rentals. On the other hand, if there is no substantial improvement or if
the score decreases, this might indicate that windspeed is not a strong predictor in this context or that itcomplicates
the model unnecessarily.

Recommendations
To improve the models further, it would be beneficial to explore the potential interactions between variables and
consider using cross-validation to ensure the robustness of the findings. This analysis sets the foundation for
refining our understanding of the factors influencing bike rentals and improving prediction accuracy.

Overall, the exploration of these two models provides a clearer picture of the dynamics at play in bike sharing, and
further investigation could lead to more effective predictive strategies.
